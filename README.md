In this repository you will find the necessary codes to reproduce the analysis and slides seen for the RPubs document [Adjusting for Batch Effect in Microarray Expression Data](https://rpubs.com/erikinwest/draft). Within this directory the following files will reproduce the results:

1. batch_effects.R: Creates all charts and analysis
2. fs_batch_effects.R: Contains a function for creating linear contrats
3. presentation.Rmd: Creates the iosslides seen in the presentation
